# data_driven_dg

## Overview
This package provides an end-to-end data driven approach for picking thin objects from a dense clutter. It is developed based on our pevious model-based manipulation technique named 'dig-grasping', where the object is picked and singulated out of the cluster by a direct physical interaction with gripper. In this package, we train the robot to learn how to plan for optimized dig-grasping parameters to pick objects in different shapes.
